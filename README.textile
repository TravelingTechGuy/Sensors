h3. Sensors project

This project uses:
# A Netduino Plus
# A 16x2 LCD screen
# A light sensor
# A temperature sensor
# Internet connection (I use an Asus WL-330gE as an adapter)

It shows the results of the sensors on the LCD, and attempts to send them to a Pachube feed.

It uses the following libraries (with thanks and rights to the respective authors):
# "MicroLiquidCrystal":http://microliquidcrystal.codeplex.com/ by Szymon Kobalczyk
# -Pachube Client- "Pachube Socket":http://www.gsiot.info/download/ from Getting Started with the Internet of Things by Cuno Pfister

This is a "short video":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjJpGcelyeQ I took of the result, before adding the Pachube code
This is the resulting Pachube Feed: "http://www.pachube.com/feeds/25788":http://www.pachube.com/feeds/25788
